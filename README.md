# hello_script

Script to setup the environment + a tmux session after starting the system

**This is not a project, this is just something more similar to an online backup**

Note there are a lot of paths and software the would not apply to you, adapt the script to your own needs


If you want to add your own script to your path run: *sudo ln -s $PWD/hello_script/hello /usr/bin*
